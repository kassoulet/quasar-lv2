# Quasar - Integer Overflow Distortion 

Quasar is:

- *An experimental digital audio effect that reduces audio resolution through bitcrushing and then pushes the signal into severe distortion, resulting in a chaotic and abrasive sound.*

- **A sonic black hole, collapsing audio into a digital abyss of distortion and noise.**

---

> It is strongly recommended to surround Quasar by limiters. One before to adjust the level more easily, and one after to prevent your monitors to fry ðŸ˜‡.

- Plugin format: LV2
